AirBnB_Clone
Description
The goal of this project is to deploy a simplified version of the Airbnb website on our server. This project comprises several components, making it a complete web application:

Command Interpreter: This component allows you to manipulate data without a visual interface, similar to a Shell. It's perfect for development and debugging purposes.

Website (Front-end): The front-end provides a user-friendly interface that showcases the final product to users. It includes both static and dynamic elements to enhance the user experience.

Database or Files: Your project uses a database or files to store data, where data represents objects in the Airbnb system. This ensures data persistence and retrieval.

API (Application Programming Interface): The API serves as a communication interface between the front-end and your data. It allows for actions such as retrieving, creating, deleting, and updating data objects.
